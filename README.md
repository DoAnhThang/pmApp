`1` Open VS Code -> Open Root Folder.

`2` Open Terminal -> Change directory to "backend" folder

```sh
cd backend
```

`3` Install "concurrently" package to run back-end and front-end in parallel

```sh
npm install --save concurrently
```

`4` Install packages of back-end and front-end in parallel
